# Answer:
With the rise of ChatGPT the popular AI chatbot that could essentially do the impossible, I can see that there is essentially a lot of doom and gloom as to how this will apply to the future jobs of Software Engineering. The article titled " Will A.I. Doom Human Programmer" by David Bolton seem to show us a more balanced view on the matter as there are discussion of what the AI chatbot can do and also the things that takes a human touch to get done. 

I particularly liked the balanced views set in the article by David Bolton as he explains his own experience with working with Mircrosoft's experimental A.I. Intellicode and how it assisted him with coding by saving time via setting up boilerplate code; which he could work off of. Furthermore, the con presented with this next point is that A.I. can still create buggy code and this is to be taken as a cautionary insight for people solely relying on A.I. generated codes. The reason being AI chat bots such as ChatGPT can reiterate information even if they are false and thus we have to always make sure to check the output.

Additionally, I appreciated David's explanation of ANI and AGI models as it pertains to AI. ANI being defined as an AI model with "clearly defined functionality" where as the AGI model is what you would perceive in Sci-Fi movies with an example he provided being "Data: from Star Trek" which has reasoning and creating capabilities.

Furthermore, a point that I didn't like from the article was that David didn't provide any insight into how AI has the potential to revolutionize other areas of software development or that there was a lack of elaboration on this such as software testing and debugging with AI tools. 

Overall, the article presented a quick overview of the how AI can implement itself into the Software Engineering space but still has a long way to go before any profound effects would be made to the Software Engineering as a whole. This is due to the fact that software engineering goes beyond writing lines and lines of code but rather it expands to include other programming principles and complexitied that requires the human touch. Thus, in the future implementation of AI tools would serve to help software engineers rather than replace them.
